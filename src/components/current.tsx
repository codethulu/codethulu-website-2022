The aim of this project is to examine a language specification and write a compiler from scratch using compiler development technologies currently prevalent in industry and research: this includes C++ and llvm. I will be writing a parser, type checker, and code generator for MiniC.",

        description: "The objective is to analyze a multi-class dataset to determine if it is linearly separable in its original feature space, in the feature space defined by Principal Component Analysis (PCA), in a new feature space with very high dimensions, or in all three feature spaces. To this end, we will use a multi-class perceptron to determine if the data is linearly separable and a non-linear version of PCA to project the dataset onto a very high-dimensional feature space.",
